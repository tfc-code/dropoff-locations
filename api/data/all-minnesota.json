Wait in the drive-thru line.\nOnly ballots from Edina voters accepted.\nVoters should bring only the Signature Envelope with their ballot sealed inside. Do not bring the mailing/transmittal envelope.\nMake sure to put both your driver’s license number and the last four digits of your social security number on your Signature Envelope. This ensures it will match what you submitted when registering and prevent your ballot from being rejected.\nSign your Signature Envelope before you arrive. If you are registering to vote as well, make sure a witness has also signed the envelope.\nWhen you arrive at the drop-off tent, staff will inspect each Signature Envelope to make sure it has all the above information. Missing information slows the process.\nA voter dropping off someone else’s ballot must show Elections staff their own identification and fill out an agent delivery log.\nPlease be patient and expect a wait if dropping off your ballot. Following the above steps will speed the process for everyone. To avoid lines, mail your ballot instead.\n\nNote: Ballots must be dropped off by 3 p.m. Nov. 3",
