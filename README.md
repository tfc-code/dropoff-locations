# Dropoff Locations Project

## Overview

Hello!

This is an application that we set up in advance of the 2020 general election.

As you probably remember, the 2020 election took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. This forced millions of people to vote by mail, rather than in person. At the same time, there were doubts that the USPS would be able to handle this sudden explosion in mail volume, and fears that some ballots would arrive too late and go uncounted.

In response to these concerns, Democrats began encouraging their voters to drop their ballots off at state-administered ballot dropoff boxes.

Our goal was to provide a convenient and non-intrusive way for voters to find ballot dropoff boxes near an address of their choosing.


## Getting Started

Go to the [frontend README](./fe/README.md) and [backend README](./api/README.md) and follow the instructions in each. The front- and back-ends are separate applications, so you'll need to open each sub-folder in a separate terminal window.
