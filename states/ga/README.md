Georgia is a per-county state and has two dropoff options:

    Registrars (official election office, 1/county)
    Drop boxes (scattered throughout counties, no central official source)

County registrars addresses and (where available) phone numbers are scraped from https://elections.sos.ga.gov/Elections/contactinfo.do

Dropbox info is manually copied into a spreadsheet from a third-party source that's collated a lot of dropbox info:

Attempting to go through where possible to verify information on a county-by-county basis (so far Appling and Douglas)
